He weighed in with two goals against France in the final and also converted his spot kick in the shoot-out as the Albiceleste triumphed on penalties.
                 
Since making his debut in 2005 aged 18 following his starring role in Argentina's FIFA U-20 World Cup win, Messi has won caps for 19 years running and scored in each of the last 18 (up to and including 2023). He also skippered his country to victory at the 2021 Copa Am√©rica and Finalissima 2022, and is one of just three players to have registered 100 men's international goals.
